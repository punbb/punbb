	---------------

 2. Copy (or upload) all the files contained in this archive into the directory where you want to run your forums. (e.g. /home/user/www/punbb/)
 3. Run install.php from the forum admin directory (e.g. open http://example.com/punbb/admin/install.php in your browser). Follow the instructions.

	 Requirements
	--------------
 - A webserver
 - PHP 5
 - A database where forum data is to be stored, created in one of: MySQL 4.1.2 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later or SQLite 2 or later

	 Upgrade from 1.2 or 1.3 pre release versions
	----------------------------------------------
NOTE: Make a backup of your current forum directory before proceeding. Also, don't forget to make a backup of your forum database. Use the tool mysqldump for MySQL and pg_dump if you are using PostgreSQL. If you're using SQLite, just make a backup copy of the SQLite database file. You can also make database backups via most administration tools such as MySQL Administrator, phpMyAdmin and phpPgAdmin.

	 Extension installation
	------------------------
 1. Download an extension's archive from the PunBB extensions repository or any other place. Extract it into your forumâ€™s extensions directory. (e.g. /home/user/example.com/punbb/extensions)
 2. Log into the forum and go to "Administration" console, "Extensions" section, choose "Install extensions" tab (e.g. http://example.com/punbb/admin/extensions.php?section=install). The downloaded extension will be listed there.
 3. Click the "Install extension" link to install the extension.

NOTE: You may use the pun_repository official PunBB extension to download and install extensions from PunBB repository with one click.

	 Maximizing Performance
	------------------------

 - Run it under a UNIX-like operating system!
 - Use a proper webserver such as Apache or Zeus.
 - Use a PHP cache/accelerator tool such as eAccelerator or Alternative PHP Cache.
 - Make sure that PHP has zlib support so you can enable gzip output compression in "Administration", "Settings". This greatly reduces the size of the XHTML output at a little cost of CPU time. An alternative is to use the Apache modules mod_gzip or mod_deflate. The two methods yield similar results.
 - Visit the administration interface and disable any forum features that are not used or you feel unnecessary.
